### Aslin is a 2d 8bit platformer made in Lua with Love2d.
#### Controls:
- Movement through arrows (also can jump with the spacebar)
- Esc - close application

You can create your own levels by creating new map_#.AT files.
Game automatically loads the number 0 and goes up from there.
There is a template of empty map. Size is strictly 16x16. Different numbers represent different game objects:

- 0 is empty space
- 1 is a wall
- 2 is player spawn point
- 3 is level exit
- 4 is lava

Special thanks to my friends with helping me create levels!
- Arty, aka. lunar_di - map_2.AT
- Exxo - map_4.AT, map_5.AT

(Those ones are extra hard, I highly recommend to redact map file to create "checkpoints" after making difficult jumps)
Also the last level uses the conservation of momentum after re-spawning (just a little hint)

The game is insanely basic, but it's quite fun to create levels with friends and then play them together!

Enjoy!
